Ongoing Multipath TCP deployments
=======================


Introduction
------------

Multipath TCP, specified in [RFC6824] is the most recent extension to the
the venerable Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). TCP was designed when
hosts had a single interface interface and a single IP address. Each 
TCP connection is identified by a four-tuple (source and 
destination addresses and source and destination ports) and all the
packets belonging to this connection carry this four-tuple. Once
a connection has been established, it is impossible to change any
of the elements of the four-tuple without breaking the connection.
This is a severe limitation in today's networks for several reasons.
First, many hosts are dual-stack and even if they have a single interface,
they have two or more addresses and there are different network paths
between a pair of communicating hosts. Second, many hosts have
several interfaces. A typical example are the smartphones and tablets.
Third, there is a growing number of mobile hosts on today's Internet
whose address can change as they move from one wireless network to another.
While cellular or entreprise WiFi networks try to preserve the same address
for the mobile hosts even if they move, there are many WiFi networks that
do not preserve IP addresses when hosts move from one access point to
another. 

Multipath TCP extends TCP to cope with these problems. Multipath TCP
enables endhosts to exchange data belonging to one connection over
different paths. To achieve this goal, Multipath TCP groups
several TCP connections, called subflows in [RFC6824], into
a single Multipath TCP connection. The first subflow of a Multipath
TCP connection starts with a three-way handshake like a regular
TCP connection. The main difference is that the SYN packet contains the
MP\_CAPABLE option that negotiates the utilisation of Multipath
TCP and also allows the endhosts to exchange random keys. These keys are
used for two main purposes: identify the Multipath TCP connection and
authenticate the establishment of subflows. On each host, a Multipath
TCP connection is uniquely identified with a 32 bits Token that is
derived from the key sent by the host during the establishment of
the initial subflow. Once the first subflow has been established,
any of the communicating host can create an additional subflow
(from any of its own addresses towards any of the addresses of the 
remote host). For this, a new SYN is sent with a MP\_JOIN option.
This option contains the token that identifies the Multipath TCP
connection to which the new subflow must be associated with and the
keys exchanged during the establishment of the initial subflow are used
to authenticate the newly established subflow. Such subflows can be
created and terminated at any time, which is very important for
mobile hosts. Each data can be sent over any of the subflows that
currently compose the Multipath TCP connection. If a subflow fails,
all the data that was transmitted over this subflow and has not yet been
acknowledged will be retransmitted over other subflows. If necessary,
new subflows can be created since Multipath TCP supports both make-before-break
and break-before-make. Due to space limitations, we do not provide a detailed
description of the many details of Multipath TCP. Those can be found elsewhere
[RFC6824] [NSDI11]

There are now multiple independant interoperable implementations of Multipath
TCP. The most widely used ones are the one used in iOS/macOS [Ref] and the Linux
implementation [MPTCPLinux]. Multipath TCP is supported by load balancers and
there are implementation efforts on FreeBSD and Solaris. In this document,
we describe the ongoing deployments of services that leverage the unique
capabilities of Multipath TCP and discuss the lessons that have already been
learned from this deployment.




Multipath TCP on smartphones
----------------------------

The largest deployment of Multipath TCP is on smartphones. There are two widespread
utilisations of Multipath TCP in mobile networks. The first deployment uses 
Multipath TCP to support a voice recognition application that is very sensitive
to delay. The second deployment uses Multipath TCP through SOCKS proxies to
offer higher bandwidth to smartphones by bonding their WiFi and LTE interfaces.

Hybrid access networks
----------------------

Another important use case for Multipath TCP lies in the access
networks. There are many situations where a single access network is
not sufficient to meet the requirements of a given enduser. In many
regions of the world, the available access networks only provide a
very limited bandwidth. A typical example are rural areas where it is
very costly for network operators to deploy high-bandwidth access
networks. There are many regions where rural users can only
obtain a few Mbps while users in large cities have access to
fiber-based networks that provide much higher bandwidth. Even if bandwidth
is limited, it is often possible to subscribe to different network
services that when combine provide higher bandwidth and higher resiliency. 
Several companies have deployed solutions that leverage the unique bonding
capabilities of Multipath TCP. We describe two of them. The first one relies 
on SOCKS proxies and enables endusers to efficiently combine network
services from different providers. The second is targeted at network operators
that wish to combine their fixed (e.g. xDSL) and wireless network (e.g. LTE)
to provide higher bandwidth to their customers [WT-348]. 


Combining access networks with SOCKS
....................................

SOCKS is also together with Multipath TCP to combine different access networks. 
However the endhosts using these access networks are regular hosts that
do not support Multipath TCP. To benefit the bonding capabilities of Multipath
TCP, a middlebox is installed in the LAN of the endusers. This middlebox
acts as a SOCKS client and interacts with a server in the cloud. Both
the middlebox and the cloud server use Multipath TCP and can thus exploit
any available access network provided that an IP address has been assigned
to the middlebox on each access network. With IPv4, the access network gateways
assign a private address to the middlebox that resides on their LAN. The middlebox
then intercepts all the TCP packets sent by the hosts on the LAN to
external destination. In practice, the middlebox can achieve this goal by
acting as the main DHCP server in the LAN and disabling the DHCP servers on
the attached access network gateways. Since the middlebox acts as the default
gateway for the LAN, it intercepts all TCP packets and proxies them over
Multipath TCP connections towards the SOCKS server running in the cloud.
This server terminates the Multipath TCP connections and initiates regular
TCP connections to the final destinations.

This solution is already commercially deployed in two countries. Users
report that they have used it to successfully combine xDSL (from ADSL to vDSL),
DOCSIS, 3G, 4G and even satellite links.  


Multipath TCP in hybrid access networks
.......................................


Various network operators have deployed both fixed networks such as xDSL
and wireless networks such as LTE. These two types of networks have different
characteristics and different usage patterns. For example, the busy hours
on LTE networks tend to be during the day while the busy hours of home
users is more during the evening. There are many regions where combining
such different access networks would increase the performance as perceived
by the endusers. Several solutions are currently being developed [WT-348].
Some of them leverage Multipath TCP to efficiently support TCP connections.
A simple deployment is shown in figure {CPE}. Other deployments may use
different devices for the wired and the wireless networks.


{figure CPE with both xDSL and LTE, simpler to explain}


client --- cpe ------ xDSL ---- HAG ---- server
            +-------- LTE  -----+


In this deployment, neither the client nor the server support
Multipath TCP. Multipath TCP is used on the CPE and
in the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway (HAG) that resides in a
datacenter of the network operator that provides the
two access networks that are combined. 

When a client iniates a TCP connection towards a remote
server, it sends a SYN packet. This packet is intercepted
by the CPE that virtually terminates the TCP connection
and then adds the MP_CAPABLE TCP before forwarding the
packet over the xDSL network. The HAG, that resides on the path
followed by all packets sent by the client over the xDSL network,
intercepts the SYN packet. It virtually terminates the Multipath TCP
connection and then forwards the SYN towards the server after having
removed the MP_CAPABLE option. The server confirms the establishment
of the connection by sending a SYN+ACK. This packet is intercepted by
the HAG that updates its state for this connection and adds an
MP_CAPABLE option before forwarding it towards the CPE. The CPE
performs similar operations. It updates its state and finally forwards
the SYN+ACK to the client without the MP_CAPABLE option to 
confirm the establishment of the connection. At this point, there
are three TCP connections. The first one is a regular TCP connection. It 
starts at the client and is virtually terminated on the CPE. The
second is a Multipath TCP connection that is virtually terminated
on the CPE and the HAG. Finally, there is a regular TCP connection
between the HAG and the remote server. From an operational viewpoint,
it is important to note that with IPv6, neither the CPE nor the HAG
need to translate the source and destination addresses of the forwarded
TCP packets. The client IP address remains visible to the destination
server. This is an important advantage compared to a SOCKS-based solution.
Furthemore, the end-to-end connection can be created in within a single
round-trip-time. This is important for short TCP connections.





Conclusion
----------

Despite its young age, Multipath TCP has already been deployed at a large
scale on the Internet. 

Like all TCP extensions, Multipath TCP was designed by assuming that the
two communicating hosts would support it. This corresponds to the largest
deployment on smartphones. However, Multipath TCP's ability to efficiently
combine various access networks has attracted new use cases where the
multipath capability is provided as a service inside the network even
when only one or none of the communicating hosts support Multipath TCP.
